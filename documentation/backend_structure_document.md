# Backend Structure Document

## Introduction

This document explains the backend side of our AI-based, Spotify-integrated music player. The backend is the engine that makes everything work behind the scenes – from taking the playlist description provided by the user to continuously updating the playlist based on feedback like thumbs up, thumbs down, and skip actions. This section also sets the stage by reminding us that the project aims to create a personalized radio station experience with a retro, 1990s-inspired flair, where technology and design come together to offer something both modern and nostalgic.

## Backend Architecture

Our backend is designed using Node.js with the Express.js framework. The choice of these technologies ensures that the server can handle real-time requests smoothly and is easy to maintain over time. We have organized the code so that every part of the system is clearly separated. For example, different modules take care of interacting with Spotify, managing user interactions, and handling the AI’s prompts. This structure not only makes our backend scalable, but it also means that improvements or bug fixes in one area will not affect the others. The design follows common patterns that have proved effective in modern web applications, aiming for strong performance and simple maintenance.

## Database Management

In this project the Replit DB is used for data storage. Our backend stores basic user interactions, such as whether a user gave a thumbs up, thumbs down, or skipped a song, as well as some historical data. While Replit DB is a simple database, it is effective for our needs as it organizes data quickly and is easy to use and maintain. The database is structured in a way that makes it simple to fetch the latest feedback and historical listening habits, which the AI engine then uses to update the playlist without delay.

## API Design and Endpoints

The application has been built with clear API routes to handle interactions between the front end and the backend. We have designed RESTful endpoints that respond to commands such as starting the music player, updating interactions, and refreshing the playlist using the AI engine. For instance, there is an endpoint that accepts a text description to generate the initial playlist, another that receives real-time user feedback like control interactions, and one that communicates with Spotify’s API for playing songs. All these endpoints work together to ensure that when a user interacts with the app, their input reaches the right part of our system quickly and reliably.

## Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted on Replit, a cloud-based hosting platform that makes it easy to develop and deploy web applications. Replit was chosen because it simplifies collaboration and provides an environment where the code runs efficiently in the cloud. This hosting solution supports scalability, meaning that as the app evolves and if more advanced features are added, the back end can grow with it. Moreover, using Replit keeps hosting costs predictable while ensuring a reliable service for our personal and low-traffic use case.

## Infrastructure Components

Behind the scenes, several infrastructure components work together to keep the system performing well. The central server, built with Node.js and Express.js, acts as the control center that organizes all incoming requests. This is complemented by Replit DB for data storage and by the API integrations with Spotify and the AI engine. There is also a basic caching strategy in place to make sure that the most recent user interactions are quickly accessible and that real-time updates occur without unnecessary delays. Although we are not using sophisticated load balancers or CDNs at the moment, the overall infrastructure is designed to handle the expected light traffic and can be upgraded in the future if needed.

## Security Measures

Security for this project is kept straightforward. User authentication is managed through Spotify OAuth or API key login, ensuring that only authorized users access the system. Since the project is designed for personal use, data storage is simple and does not involve advanced security protocols. However, the basic protection measures in place help prevent unauthorized usage while keeping the system open and responsive. Data exchanges between the backend and external services, like Spotify and the AI engine, are secured using standard methods ensuring that user commands and feedback are safely transmitted.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

To ensure that the backend runs smoothly, monitoring tools embedded in the Replit environment and basic logging practices are used to track the health and performance of the system. Regular checks on the API responses and the effectiveness of the AI-driven playlist updates help identify any issues quickly. Maintenance is kept simple, with routine updates to dependencies and scripts ensuring that the back end remains reliable. The development setup includes automated tests and error-handling methods so that any issues are caught early and fixed promptly, keeping the system’s uptime high and the user experience seamless.

## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

In summary, the backend of our AI-driven Spotify music player is built on a strong and straightforward foundation using Node.js and Express.js, with Replit DB handling data storage. All API endpoints are designed for clear communication between the front end and the servers, while integrations with Spotify and the AI engine ensure that user feedback leads to immediate and effective playlist adjustments. The hosting on Replit guarantees ease of deployment and scalability. Although the security measures are kept basic due to the personal use focus, they are sufficient for the project’s scope. Overall, the backend has been carefully structured to deliver a smooth, dynamic, and personalized music experience that aligns perfectly with the project’s goals and design philosophy.
