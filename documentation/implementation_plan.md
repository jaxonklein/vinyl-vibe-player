**Phase 1: Environment Setup**

1.  Install Node.js on Replit. Ensure the Node.js environment is set up (using a recent stable version on Replit, e.g. Node.js v20.2.1 as referenced in similar projects) (**Tech Stack: Node.js**).
2.  Create a new Replit project and initialize a Git repository with default branches (main and dev) (**PRD Section 1: Project Overview**).
3.  Set up the required directories: create `/server` for backend code and `/public` for frontend assets (**Tech Stack Document**).
4.  **Validation:** Run `node -v` to confirm Node.js is installed and verify project structure in Replit's file explorer.

**Phase 2: Frontend Development**

1.  Create the main HTML file at `/public/index.html` with a retro 1990s-inspired design including a text input form for the playlist description (**PRD Section 3: User Flow**).
2.  Develop a CSS file at `/public/styles.css` to apply bold fonts and vibrant colors for a nostalgic UI experience (**PRD Section 4: Retro User Interface**).
3.  Create a JavaScript file at `/public/app.js` to manage UI interactions such as form submission and player control events (**Core Features: User Interaction and Playlist Initialization**).
4.  Implement UI components for basic music player controls: play, pause, thumbs up, thumbs down, and skip. Add corresponding buttons in the HTML and style them in `/public/styles.css` (**PRD Section 4: Music Player Controls**).
5.  **Validation:** Open the app in a browser and verify that the text input and player controls display correctly with the intended retro design.

**Phase 3: Backend Development**

1.  Set up an Express server by creating `/server/app.js` and initializing an Express application (**Tech Stack Document: Express.js**).
2.  Create an authentication module in `/server/auth.js` to support Spotify OAuth and API key login. Integrate necessary endpoints for login and callback (**PRD Section 4: Spotify API Integration and Authentication**).
3.  Implement a POST endpoint at `/api/playlist` in `/server/playlist.js` that accepts the playlist description from the frontend and triggers the LLM to generate an initial playlist (**PRD Section 3: Inputting the Playlist Description**).
4.  Create an interaction endpoint in `/server/interact.js` at POST `/api/interact` to process user actions (thumbs up, thumbs down, skip) and update the playlist dynamically by calling the LLM-based preference prediction engine (**PRD Section 3: Dynamic Playlist Generation and Updates**).
5.  Develop the LLM integration module in `/server/llm.js` that wraps calls to the OpenAI API (or similar) to re-prompt and generate updated playlists based on both the new user input and historical session data (**Core Features: Dynamic Playlist Curation and AI Engine**).
6.  Implement a simple data persistence layer by creating `/server/db.js` to connect and interact with Replit DB for storing user interactions and historical playlist data (**PRD Section 6: Data Storage Considerations**).
7.  **Validation:** Use curl or Postman to send test requests to `/api/playlist` and `/api/interact`, ensuring proper JSON responses and error handling.

**Phase 4: Integration**

1.  Update `/public/app.js` to perform a fetch or axios call to POST the playlist description from the text input to `/api/playlist` when the user submits the form (**PRD Section 3: Inputting the Playlist Description**).
2.  In `/public/app.js`, add event listeners on the player control buttons (play, pause, thumbs up, thumbs down, skip) to send interaction events via POST to `/api/interact` (**PRD Section 3: Music Player Controls**).
3.  In `/server/app.js`, configure the Express server to serve static files from `/public` and set up necessary CORS middleware to allow frontend–backend communication (**Tech Stack: Backend**).
4.  Integrate Spotify API calls within the backend modules where necessary. For example, after receiving a valid interaction from the frontend, invoke Spotify’s playback control endpoints to manage song playback (**PRD Section 4: Integrating Spotify Tools and AI Control**).
5.  **Validation:** Run the web app locally on Replit, simulate form submission and button clicks, and verify that corresponding backend endpoints are triggered and responses are received.

**Phase 5: Deployment**

1.  Configure the Replit project for deployment by creating a `.replit` file with a startup command such as `node server/app.js` to launch the server (**Deployment Section: Replit Hosting**).
2.  Set up Replit secrets/environment variables for sensitive information, including Spotify API credentials and OpenAI API key (**PRD Section 7: Constraints & Assumptions**).
3.  Ensure that logging and error handling are enabled in the Express server to monitor runtime issues (**PRD Section 8: Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls**).
4.  **Validation:** Deploy the application on Replit, access the generated URL on an iOS device, and perform end-to-end testing by simulating authentication, playlist input, and player control interactions.

**Final Checks and Testing**

1.  Add error-handling middleware in Express (within `/server/app.js`) to gracefully catch and log errors from API calls and Spotify integration (**PRD Section 8: Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls**).
2.  Write basic unit tests for critical backend endpoints and UI interactions to ensure continuous reliability (**Integration: Testing**).
3.  **Validation:** Manually test the complete user flow: authentication, description submission, initial playlist generation, and real-time updates via simulated user interaction. Verify that the LLM-based engine updates the playlist and that Spotify playback is controlled as expected.

**Note:** When integrating with Next.js in future iterations (if needed), remember to install Next.js 14 as it is recommended for integration with current AI coding tools. For now, build the interface using traditional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to match the project's simplicity and retro design requirements.

This step-by-step plan ensures the project is organized into clear phases, each with specific tasks and validations referencing the PRD and Tech Stack documents.
